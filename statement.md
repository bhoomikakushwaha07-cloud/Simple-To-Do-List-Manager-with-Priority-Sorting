# Project Statement: Simple To-Do List Manager with Priority Sorting

## Problem Statement
Managing daily tasks efficiently can be challenging, especially when juggling multiple tasks with varying importance. Many existing tools are either too complex or require constant internet connectivity. This project aims to create a lightweight, offline, and easy-to-use command-line To-Do List Manager designed to help users prioritize and manage their tasks effectively.

## Scope of the Project
- A command-line Python application requiring no external dependencies beyond Python 3.
- Supports adding tasks with priorities, viewing sorted tasks, marking tasks complete, and deleting tasks.
- Uses a simple bubble sort algorithm to maintain tasks sorted by priority.
- Intended as an offline personal task management tool without intricate features like deadlines, notifications, or multi-user support.

## Target Users
- Students managing coursework and assignments.
- Professionals seeking a straightforward, distraction-free task organizer.
- Beginners learning Python programming through practical projects.
- Users preferring an offline, minimalistic approach to task management.

## High-Level Features
- Add tasks with a description and assign priorities (High, Medium, Low).
- View tasks sorted automatically by priority.
- Mark tasks as completed to track progress.
- Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- Simple, interactive text-based menu for easy navigation.
