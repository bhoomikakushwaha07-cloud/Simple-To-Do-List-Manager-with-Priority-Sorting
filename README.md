# Simple To-Do List Manager with Priority Sorting

## Overview
This is a simple command-line To-Do List Manager written in Python. It helps users manage their daily tasks by adding, viewing, marking complete, and deleting tasks. Tasks can be prioritized with numeric values (1 = High, 2 = Medium, 3 = Low), and the list is always displayed in sorted order of priority using a bubble sort algorithm. This project is great for beginners to practice Python programming basics such as lists, functions, sorting, and user input.

## Features
- Add new tasks with a description and priority (High, Medium, Low).
- View tasks sorted by priority.
- Mark tasks as complete.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Simple text-based menu interface.

## Technologies/Tools Used
- Python 3.x (tested with Python 3.8 or higher)
- Command-line interface (terminal/console)

## Steps to Install & Run the Project
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Clone the repository
3. Navigate to the project directory
4. Run the Python script
5. Follow the on-screen menu for task management.

## Instructions for Testing
- Run the program and try adding tasks with different priorities.
- View the list to verify the sorting by priority.
- Mark a task as complete and check the status symbol changes.
- Delete a task and confirm it is removed from the list.
- Try entering invalid input (e.g., invalid menu choice, non-numeric task numbers) to see error handling in action.
